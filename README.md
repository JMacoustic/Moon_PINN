# Dynamic Meta-PINN

This is a implementation of Finite PINN model including temporal axis. Generates 3x3 metamaterial structure with triangular mesh and simulates dynamics.


## Installation

First, clone repository.

    git clone https://github.com/JMacoustic/Moon_PINN.git

Next, go into the cloned repo and train the model.
    
    cd path/to/cloned/repo/
    python train.py

## Run

Once you train the model, it will automatically start simulation right after.
